# Changelog

All notable changes will be documented here. FORGE follows milestone evidence before public
semantic-version commitments begin at v1.0.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Milestone 0 constitutional, legal, packaging, tooling, testing, and CI foundation.
- Strict schema-versioned M1 canonical contracts and deterministic JSON Schema export.
- Project configuration validation, owner identity bootstrap, and repository discovery.
- Non-destructive `forge init` with safe `.gitignore` merging and repository-bound path checks.
- `forge config show|validate` and stable error categories for the implemented command surface.
- Ordered event journals, deterministic replay, atomic snapshots, and mismatch detection.
- Data-only pack validation, immutable pack/workflow locks, initiative creation, manual runs,
  workflow authority checks, status, and next-action reporting.

### Limitations

- Artifact, claim, check, evidence, acceptance, handoff, import, and closure services are not yet
  implemented. Conditioned transitions remain blocked until their governed records exist.
- Project and distribution naming remain provisional.
